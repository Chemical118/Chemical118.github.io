### Welcome!

I am an undergraduate student in Division of Biotechnology, Korea University.
I'm also very interested in scientific computing, so I know a lot of different programming languages.
My first tier programming languages are Julia, Python, C++ and I can also handle R and Bash.
What I enjoy most is using computing to solve scientific problems, especially biology.

Currently, I'm working with Dr. [Jun Kim](https://github.com/JunKimCNU) Assistant Professor in Chungnam National University and we develop various automation tools for genetics.
I am also interested in creating tools for various biological fields beyond genetics, such as RNA-sequencing.
If you want to realize your biological ideas in computing, please contact me via email.
