### Welcome!

I am an undergraduate student in Division of Biotechnology, Korea University.
Iâ€™m very interested in solving scientific problems using a lot of different programming languages.
My first-tier programming languages are Julia, Python, and C++. I can also handle R and Bash.
What I enjoy most is using computing to solve scientific problems, especially biological problems.

Currently, I'm working with Dr. [Jun Kim](https://github.com/JunKimCNU), Assistant Professor of Chungnam National University.
We have developed several automated computation tools for genetics and genomics based on whole-genome sequencing data.
I am also interested in developing computational tools for various biological fields beyond genetics, such as RNA sequencing.
If you want to implement your biological ideas using computational methods, please feel free to contact me via e-mail.
